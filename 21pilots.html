    <h1><i>The Pantaloon</i></h1>


    <h3><b>a song by <a href="21pilotsinfo.html"><i>twenty one pilots</i></a></b></h3>

    <b><i>lyrics <sup><a href="somesource.com">[@]</a></sup></i></b>
    <p>
        Your grandpa died when you were nine <br>
        They said he had lost his mind <br>
        You have learned way too soon <br>

        You should never trust the Pantaloon <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, it's your turn to be alone <br>
        Find a wife and build yourself a home <br>
        You have learned way too soon <br>
        That your dad is now the Pantaloon <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        You are tired, you are hurt <br>
        A moth ate through your favorite shirt <br>
        And all your friends fertilize the ground you walk <br>
        Lose your mind <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        He's seen too many stare-downs between the sun and the moon in the morning air <br>
        How he used to hustle all the people walking through the fairgrounds <br>
        He's been around so long he's changed his meaning of a chair, now, because a chair, now <br>
        Is like a tiny island in the sea of all the people <br>
        Who glide across the very surface that made his bones feeble <br>
        The end can't come soon enough, but is it too soon? <br>
        Either way, he can't deny he is a Pantaloon <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        You are tired, you are hurt <br>
        A moth ate through your favorite shirt <br>
        And all your friends fertilize the ground you walk <br>
        Lose your mind <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        You like to sleep alone, it's colder than you know <br>
        'Cause your skin is so used to colder bones <br>
        It's warmer in the morning than what it is at night <br>
        Your bones are held together by your nightmares and your frights <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        You are tired, you are hurt <br>
        A moth ate through your favorite shirt <br>
        And all your friends, they fertilize the ground you walk <br>
        So lose your mind <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        You are tired, you are hurt <br>
        A moth ate through your favorite shirt <br>
        And all your friends, they fertilize the ground you walk <br>
        Lose your mind <br>
    </p>
